2. Static: used on functions and classes to indicate that the method/value belongs to the class itself, not the object of the class.
Const: used on values to declare that they are not modifiable
readonly: similar to Const, but the readonly modifier allows the variable to be initialized at runtime, while const is known by compile time.

3. A constructor is a special method in a class with the same name that is used for initializing an object of the class

4. Partial shows that the other parts of the class or interface can be define in the namespace.

5. A tuple is a generic data structure that holds same type values

6. The record keyword is used to define a reference type that have contain encapsulation functionality.

7. Overloading refers to when two methods have the same name but different parameter arguments. Overriding is when a child class uses its own method name instead of the parent method.

8. A field is a variable that is defined inside the class, while a property provides a way to access the fields inside a class.

9. You can make an optional parameter by initializing the parameter with a value after the required parameters.

10. An interface is a contract that requires any classes that implement the interface to implement every function declared inside.

11. Interfaces are always public.
